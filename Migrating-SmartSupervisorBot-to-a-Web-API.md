# ðŸš€ Migrating SmartSupervisorBot to a Web API

Recently, I decided to change my project, **SmartSupervisorBot**, from a Console app to a Web API. Let me explain why I made this decision:



## Why I Changed My Console App to a Web API

The main reason was **flexibility**. A Web API makes it easier to manage bot features. In the future, I plan to create an **admin panel using Angular**. A Web API also makes it simple to connect with other tools or systems.



## Why I Chose AOT (Ahead-Of-Time Compilation)

I picked **AOT** because it makes the app **faster** and uses less **memory**. AOT compiles the code before running the app, so it doesnâ€™t waste time compiling while the app is running. This is very helpful since many requests come from **Telegram users**, and the app needs to respond quickly.



## Why I Used Minimal API

**Minimal API** is great for small and focused projects like mine. It helps keep the code **simple** and **clean** by removing unnecessary complexity, like controllers. This makes development faster and easier to manage.



## Why I Used OpenAiJsonSerializerContext

I used **OpenAiJsonSerializerContext** to handle JSON data more efficiently. Instead of relying on runtime processes, it **pre-generates the code** for working with JSON. This saves time and resources, especially when thereâ€™s a lot of data to process, like user requests.
